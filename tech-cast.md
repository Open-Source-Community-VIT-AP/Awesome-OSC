  <h3>
  APIs
  </h3>
  <p>
    An API(Application Programming Interface) is a intermediate software that allows two applications running on different networks or same network communicate with each other. For example when you are using a mobile app, the software in your mobile needs to communicate with the server to send and request data. An API provides the medium through which
  the requests are accpeted, processed and it tells the server what to send as a response. An API provides a layer of security by not exposing your full data to the server, but only sending the required data mostly in the form of JSON.<br>

  <h3>
  REST API</h3>
  <p> REST stands for Representational State Transfer.<br>
  
 An API is considered as a REST API only if it follows the REST architectural style.The REST architecture consists the following criteria - <br>
  <ul>
    <li>The server should not store any client information between the requests.<br></li>
    <li>The Application must have a client server architecture where the requests must be managed through standard protocols like HTTP.<br></li>
    <li>The resources received as response can be manipulated by the user.<br></li>
    <li>The responses must contain descriptive messages that have information about the request status and other information.<br></li>
  </ul>

  These are some of the basic points, for more info about REST APIs visit the following page - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer<br>
  <h3>GraphQL</h3>
  <p>
  GraphQL is an open source data query and manipualtion language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. It provides the users with features to define the structure of the data that they get as a response from the server which helps in preventing data loss and makes the response faster as only the required data is sent to the client from the server.<br>
